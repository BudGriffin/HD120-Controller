# HD120-Controller
Arduino sketch to act as a custom controller for Corsair HD120 RGB Fans

Copyright 2017 Kit Parenteau

Version score: 0.1.1.0

The lighting controller that comes standard for HD120 RGB fans left something to be desired.
This code allows a 5V Arduino AVR to be used as a controller for the fan lighting.
* An Arduino Micro or Micro Pro is recommended due to its physical size and hardware capabilities
* FastLED Library 3.1 or newer, and Arduino.cc IDE 1.8.1 or newer are required.

This is the initial version of this software. It is -NOT- the same as the video, which uses demo code to control the lights globally. I will hopefully implement some of the video functions as modes. 

Consider this to be an ALPHA version. Some assembly required. Do not taunt code. Comments may cause sweating or blindness.

Changelog
0.1.1.0 - February 6, 2017
* ADDED: Two more fan modes
* ADDED: Local compile size tracking in comments
* IMPROVED: Cleaned up code and increased comment clarity
